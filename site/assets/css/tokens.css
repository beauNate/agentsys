/*
 * AGENTSYS DESIGN SYSTEM
 *
 * Imports shared tokens and base styles from the monorepo design-system.
 * Site-specific overrides can be added below the imports.
 *
 * Brand Personality
 * -----------------
 * AgentSys is a modular runtime and orchestration system for AI agents.
 * 12 plugins. 41 agents. 27 skills. Structured pipelines for development workflows.
 *
 * Voice:  Precise, confident, effortless. The tool that does the work
 *         so you can ship. Never shouts, never hesitates.
 * Tone:   Premium but approachable. Technical but never intimidating.
 *         Like talking to a senior engineer who respects your time.
 * Feel:   Linear's craftsmanship. Vercel's speed. Stripe's trust.
 *         Dark, quiet power - the UI disappears, the work gets done.
 *
 * Design Principles
 * -----------------
 * 1. DEPTH THROUGH SUBTLETY  - Layers revealed by translucency, not borders
 * 2. MOTION WITH PURPOSE     - Every animation communicates state, never decorates
 * 3. INFORMATION DENSITY     - Developers want data, not whitespace
 * 4. GLOW OVER SHADOW        - Light radiates from content, not cast by it
 * 5. MONOCHROME + ONE ACCENT - Near-black canvas, purple-to-cyan signature gradient
